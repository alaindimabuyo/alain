  **I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state of mind, and I don't think people should
  settle for less than they deserve. I always look toward the next best thing. I like seeing other
  people happy. When someone else is down, it breaks my heart. I've been through more
  than most people my age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger. Life has thrown me
  challenges, and so far, I've come out on top. I realized who my real friends are, and that
  my family always comes first..always. There is more to life
  than beauty on the outside. It's about what's on the inside. That's what really counts.
